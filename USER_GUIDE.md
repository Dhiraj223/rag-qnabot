## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Document Q&A System! This application allows you to upload documents, index them for quick searching, and then ask questions about the content using a chat-like interface. The system uses advanced AI to understand your questions and provide relevant answers based on the uploaded documents.

## 2. Getting Started

When you first open the application, you'll see a sidebar with three main options:

4. Wait for the file to upload and process. You'll see a success message when it's done.
5. In the "Index your document" section, enter a name for your index.
6. Click the "Create Index" button.

## 6. Tips for Effective Use

- Be specific in your questions to get more accurate answers.
- If you're not getting the information you need, try rephrasing your question.
- Remember that the AI can only answer based on the content of the uploaded document.
- For complex topics, consider breaking down your questions into smaller, more specific queries.

## 7. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Make sure your document is in a supported format (.txt, .pdf, .docx).
- If indexing fails, try uploading a smaller document or breaking your document into smaller parts.
- If you're not getting relevant answers, double-check that you've selected the correct index for your document.
- If the application seems unresponsive, try refreshing the page.
